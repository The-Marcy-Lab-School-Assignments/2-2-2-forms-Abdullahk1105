# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

We need `labels` for every `input` because we can use these `labels` to decribe what each `input` does on our websites. This makes it easier for the user because they can read what the `input` is for. For example, if you have a email `input`, you can have a `label` for that `input` with text content that says "Enter email here", this lets our user know where the `input` for email is. By using `aria-label/aria-labelledby`, this attribute describes what an element does and is useful to make a website accessible to people with disabilities. The First way to associate a `label` with an `input` is by using `label` with the `for` attribute with the same value as the inputs `id`. The second way to associate a `label` with an `input` is by putting our `input` tag inside of our `label` tag.

# Which looks something like this:

```html
<label>
  <input type="text" name="username" />
  Enter username
</label>
```
