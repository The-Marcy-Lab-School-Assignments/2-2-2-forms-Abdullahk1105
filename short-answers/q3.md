# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

The default behavior for the first button is just a button being created, if you have that inside a `form` the default behavior for it makes it a submit button. The second button creates a button that submits a form on our website . The third creates a button that resets a form to its orignal state on our website. The fourth creates a clickable button that does nothing.
