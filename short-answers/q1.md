# Question

Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```

to this:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer

This happens because when we submit a form it takes the name attribute from our html and it makes it a "variable" and it assigns the user inputs to these "variables". Everytime that form is submitted it is sent to a server. We can stop this by using the .preventDefault(); and this will stop the page from automatically reloading everytime we press submit on a page.
